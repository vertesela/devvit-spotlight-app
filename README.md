# 🌟 Spotlight - Pin comments that matter

Sometimes the most helpful comment in a thread comes from someone who isn’t a mod - a company rep, an expert, or just a user with the right context. Normally you can’t pin their reply. Spotlight fixes that.

**Spotlight** is a Dev Platform app that lets moderators, trusted users, and (optionally) the original poster (OP) pin another user’s comment to the top of a post.

---

## What Spotlight does

- **Allows mods, trusted users, and OPs (if enabled) to pin comments**
- **Lets mods remove any comment created by the app**
- **Can automatically apply a post flair when a comment is spotlighted**
- **Supports optional Discord webhook notifications**

All of this can be configured in the app settings.

## How to use it

### Trusted users, mods and OPs

1. **Moderators** add trusted users in the [Dev Platform settings](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/spotlight-app) - e.g. verified accounts, popular helpers – up to the mods.

2. To spotlight a comment, open it and select Spotlight from the menu.

3. Fill out the short form and confirm. The comment will be pinned under the post.

That’s all you need to do.

### If you're a regular user and want to use Spotlight

- Spotlight isn’t automatically available to everyone. If you’d like the ability to spotlight comments on a specific subreddit, contact that sub’s moderators and ask them to add you as a trusted user.

- Whether they grant access is entirely up to the moderation team of that subreddit.

---

## Optional features

### Automatic flair

- You can set a custom flair that’s applied once a comment is spotlighted.
- Useful for posts where added context or clarification needs to be visible.

#### Example:

```
Context Provided – Spotlight
```

- You can enable this feature and customize the flair text in the app settings

### OP spotlighting

- Mods can allow the original poster to spotlight another user’s comment - helpful for AMAs, Q&A threads, or posts where the OP is actively involved.

### Anonymous spotlight

- Trusted users (and OPs, if enabled) can choose to spotlight a comment without showing their username publicly.

- **Public comment format:**

  > 📌 u/TrustedUser has pinned a comment by u/ExampleUser.

- **Anonymous format:**

  > 📌 Pinned comment from u/ExampleUser.

- Mods will still see who performed the action in the logs.

---

## Mod Tools

- Configure the app through your Dev Platform settings.

- To remove a comment posted by `u/spotlight-app`, open the comment → mod tools → `[Spotlight] Delete content`.

- All spotlight actions are logged in `/w/spotlight/logs` on your subreddit.

---

## What the app posts

Depending on who spotlighted the comment, Spotlight will post:

- **Moderator:**

  > 📌 Mods have pinned a comment by u/{author}.

- **OP:**

  > 📌 u/{OP} has pinned a comment by u/{author}.

- **Trusted user:**

  > 📌 u/{TrustedUser} has pinned a comment by u/{author}.

- **Anonymous:**
  > 📌 Pinned comment from u/{author}.

If you run into any issues or have questions, please do not message the bot or the app directly because that inbox isn’t monitored.
